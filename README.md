## Log Book

**Thoughts:** excited! I am almost done with this project and I start feeling confident with Flexbox.

### Day 2: January 4. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Finish working on my Treehouse's Techdegree project and have submitted it. Did a lot of CSS refactoring and responsive design.

**Thoughts:** A bit tired: I am waking up at 5:00 at the moment in order to work during one hour and a half and two hours. However I have discovered some pretty cool tools for accessibility issues :).

### Day 3: January 5. Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Restart working on my Web App Dashboard which is my new Treehouse's project. Created a dropdown menu on click event and started discovering ChartJS.

**Thoughts:** It is hard to add the proper style to a dropdown menu (I have to use relative and absolute positionning). ChartJS seems to be quite simple to use however.

### Day 4: January 6. Friday

**Today's Progress:** Implemented my first chart element with ChartJS and Canvas and added styles on it. Worked with canvas for the construction of the layout. However it seems that I need a trick in order to integrate multiple Chart element on a same page.

**Thoughts:** I have the feeling to be on a roll even though I encounter difficulties from time to time: this is such a great feeling :D!

### Day 5: January 7. Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Add two new chart elements to the page: a bar chart and a doughnut chart. It seems they work fine for now. Also add the next section which represents a social network dashboard: add the basic style to this section especially the layout and the color of these free elements.

**Thoughts:** I usually work in the morning but I was not at home today. So I have decided to work this evening and I was no sure to be fully concentrated. It was the case (coool) even though I think I would have been more efficient in the morning ;)

### Day 6: January 8. Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Tried to add the three svgs elements and had not figured how it would work. Start adding the new container for the new members & the activity member: add the very first styles to both elements.

**Thoughts:** A bit frustrated! I have been blocked on svg elements and their relative parents elements. Did not understand why I can properly add a border radius .. :/

**Link to Work:** [Web App Dashboard](https://github.com/tdimnet/Web-App-Dashboard)


### Day 7: January 9. Monday

**Today's Progress:** Focused on adding the final elements in the html file & also added some nice styles to them. Still have some elements to add like svg images or profile picture images.

**Thoughts:** Each time I have encountered a difficulty which blocks me more than 10 minutes, I have decided to skip and to work what I immediatly know. I do not know if the method is good. Will find out soon!

### Day 8: January 10. Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Remove the labels of the chart elements and create the layout for mobile devices.

**Thoughts:** Youhou, this is my first week! Seriously everything I have done this morning seems to have worked just fine: it is a very cool feeling and I think this project is almost done!

### Day 9: January 11. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Work on the layout for tablet devices and start setting up the layout for desktop devices. I still have some issues but it starts taking shape :)!

**Thoughts:** I am tired and it was hard to be completely focused at the at the beginning. However my work is going on and I will end this project soon.

### Day 10: January 12. Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Hard time to work with svgs icons especially when I need to resize them. I will have some good and nice refactoring to do!

**Thoughts:** It was not my best session ever. I am a little disappointed of myself: I have the feeling I have lost my time today :(.

**Link to Work:** [Web App Dashboard](https://github.com/tdimnet/Web-App-Dashboard)


### Day 11: January 13. Friday

**Today's Progress:** Continue Implementing JavaScript features and additional styles for the desktop layout.

**Thoughts:** The project is 70% over and I have now to work on my details. I never know if I like or hate this part: making small improvements is a great work but it also takes times. I think this project will be over at the end of the week-end!

### Day 12: January 14. Saturday

**Thoughts:** I think I just need some rest :).

**Link to Work:**


### Day 13: January 15. Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Start refactoring my work with sass. For now everything is working great and I do not have a lot of issues. I have also created a new branch for my work.

**Thoughts:** Why do I not work with Sass more often? For simple but nice websites, it is not completely useful but for larger websites with a lot of layout rules, it helps so much!

### Day 14: January 16. Monday

**Today's Progress:** Great work with the sass refactoring of the project. I have discovered some issues and I think I'll work on it also this evening and not only this morning.

### Day 15: January 17. Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Continue refactoring the site with Sass and working with SVGs. There are now five SVG icons for social medias and they are displaying great on mobile devices.

**Thoughts:** I have understood something important with SVG and this is great! And once again, I have seen how much I love working with Sass.

### Day 16: January 18. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Finish refactoring the mobile version with Sass and start making some nice improvements. Add also buttons and input transitions.

### Day 17: January 19. Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Adding Toggle Switch at the bottom of the page and import the chart elements. Everything is now perfect for the mobile version, I can start working on tablet and desktop devices.

**Link to Work:** [Web App Dashboard](https://github.com/tdimnet/Web-App-Dashboard)


### Day 18: January 20. Friday

**Today's Progress:** Make improvements for the tablet devices by adding new styles and new layouts. I have not seen any bugs yet. Once I am done with the layout refactoring, I will have some nice changes to do with the JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I am starting to get the point of this project. As always, I find it very interesting and it makes me ask questions to myself about how I should organize my code and how could I improve my work flow. That's so nice!

### Day 22: January 24. Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Big day today! I have finally finished the ninth Techdegree project and I have submitted it! I have also continued working on the tenth Techdegree project and I have made it work! When the form is submitted, a Gallery of movie posters pops up!

**Thoughts:** I can finally breathe! Ok, I am starting to be anxious for the final exam but that's cool :). I am also very happy because I understand pretty well (I hope) how AJAX works :D.

### Day 23: January 25. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Start designing and coding the layout of the Gallery. It works almost fine for every devices (from mobile to desktop). I still have some slight issues but it is almost done. Also work with AJAX and JavaScript and display movie posters on the screen.

**Thoughts:** I was always asking myself what is the difference between two methods of event handling in JavaScript. The .click method (e.g.: I want to click a button or an image) and the .on method. Thanks to AJAX, I think I got it!

### Day 24: January 26. Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Just some small changes with the layout desktop and start planning the solution which will help me to display the image information.

### Day 25: January 27. Friday

**Today's Progress:** Make the second AJAX Request according to the image clicked and make the image appears in an overlay.

**Thoughts:** It was easier than I thought I would be :). I need to finish styling the overlay and have to keep in mind that I have to create some new callback functions.

**Thoughts:** Hey, it's Saturday, it's ten'o clock and I'm 'already' in front of my screens :D. Anyway, I'm fine (good for me! ^^) and I understand how AJAX Request works. I think I need to refactore my code a bit but I will do that on Monday or Tuesday :).
