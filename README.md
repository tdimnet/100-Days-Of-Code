## Log Book


### Day 1: January 3. Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** continue working on my Treehouse's Techdegree Project and refactore a lot of my css files.

**Thoughts:** excited! I am almost done with this project and I start feeling confident with Flexbox.

### Day 2: January 4. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Finish working on my Treehouse's Techdegree project and have submitted it. Did a lot of CSS refactoring and responsive design.

**Thoughts:** A bit tired: I am waking up at 5:00 at the moment in order to work during one hour and a half and two hours. However I have discovered some pretty cool tools for accessibility issues :).

### Day 3: January 5. Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Restart working on my Web App Dashboard which is my new Treehouse's project. Created a dropdown menu on click event and started discovering ChartJS.

**Thoughts:** It is hard to add the proper style to a dropdown menu (I have to use relative and absolute positionning). ChartJS seems to be quite simple to use however.

### Day 4: January 6. Friday

**Today's Progress:** Implemented my first chart element with ChartJS and Canvas and added styles on it. Worked with canvas for the construction of the layout. However it seems that I need a trick in order to integrate multiple Chart element on a same page.

**Thoughts:** I have the feeling to be on a roll even though I encounter difficulties from time to time: this is such a great feeling :D!
