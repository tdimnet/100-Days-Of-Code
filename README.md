## Log Book


### Day 1: January 3. Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** continue working on my Treehouse's Techdegree Project and refactore a lot of my css files.

**Thoughts:** excited! I am almost done with this project and I start feeling confident with Flexbox.

### Day 2: January 4. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Finish working on my Treehouse's Techdegree project and have submitted it. Did a lot of CSS refactoring and responsive design.

**Thoughts:** A bit tired: I am waking up at 5:00 at the moment in order to work during one hour and a half and two hours. However I have discovered some pretty cool tools for accessibility issues :).

### Day 3: January 5. Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Restart working on my Web App Dashboard which is my new Treehouse's project. Created a dropdown menu on click event and started discovering ChartJS.

**Thoughts:** It is hard to add the proper style to a dropdown menu (I have to use relative and absolute positionning). ChartJS seems to be quite simple to use however.

### Day 4: January 6. Friday

**Today's Progress:** Implemented my first chart element with ChartJS and Canvas and added styles on it. Worked with canvas for the construction of the layout. However it seems that I need a trick in order to integrate multiple Chart element on a same page.

**Thoughts:** I have the feeling to be on a roll even though I encounter difficulties from time to time: this is such a great feeling :D!

### Day 5: January 7. Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Add two new chart elements to the page: a bar chart and a doughnut chart. It seems they work fine for now. Also add the next section which represents a social network dashboard: add the basic style to this section especially the layout and the color of these free elements.

**Thoughts:** I usually work in the morning but I was not at home today. So I have decided to work this evening and I was no sure to be fully concentrated. It was the case (coool) even though I think I would have been more efficient in the morning ;)

### Day 6: January 8. Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Tried to add the three svgs elements and had not figured how it would work. Start adding the new container for the new members & the activity member: add the very first styles to both elements.

**Thoughts:** A bit frustrated! I have been blocked on svg elements and their relative parents elements. Did not understand why I can properly add a border radius .. :/

### Day 7: January 9. Monday

**Today's Progress:** Focused on adding the final elements in the html file & also added some nice styles to them. Still have some elements to add like svg images or profile picture images.

**Thoughts:** Each time I have encountered a difficulty which blocks me more than 10 minutes, I have decided to skip and to work what I immediatly know. I do not know if the method is good. Will find out soon!
