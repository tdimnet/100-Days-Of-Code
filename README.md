### Day 2: January 4. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Finish working on my Treehouse's Techdegree project and have submitted it. Did a lot of CSS refactoring and responsive design.

**Thoughts:** A bit tired: I am waking up at 5:00 at the moment in order to work during one hour and a half and two hours. However I have discovered some pretty cool tools for accessibility issues :).
